Who reaps the rewards?
They were buying a stallion to cover their mares.
Because I asked the coppers on our payroll.
And the Lords will smite the unholy when the great judgment comes.
Three days until it wanes. 
Pierced and punctured by old men for three pence a time.
Rutted upon like animals.
God damn you for soililng your uniforms!
These are the new men who will bolster your ranks.
Not before I learned to stop choking.
The tobacco wharf.
A shell full of sheep brains hurts pretty bad.
